# Introduction

Super Car Rental Services (SCRS) is one of the fast-growing Online Car Rental Service in 
Malaysia which help customer to save their time by booking rental cars online form their 
place. SCSR decided to enhance their online Car Rental booking services by allowing 
customers to book cars for rent, online. I was required by SCRS to develop a program for the 
Online Car Rental System (OCSRS) which have 3 types of users and should contains several 
features. This system will be using Python as its Programming Language. 
This system will be use by 3 types of users, which are the admin, the customers and the 
registered customers. Admin users will be asked to verify their identity by entering username 
and password before accessing the system, then they can add car to be rented out into system, 
with details, system will give a unique car id to every newly added car so the cars can be 
managed better and easier to distinguished. Admins can also modify details of existing car 
record such as car model, car transmission, hourly rate for renting the car and car types by 
giving the car id. Besides that, admins can check all records of cars available for rent and 
customer payment for a specific time duration with the system. When an order is made, they 
are also given a unique order id, and details such as total charges, order rented, payment 
status and payment date of the order will be recorded in the system. Because of that, the 
system can easily check records and give a summary of orders very quickly and smartly. 
Admins can also search a specific record of car booking or customer payment with the car id 
or the username of the customer, the system is capable to link cars’ data to order’s data and 
manage them very well. Lastly, admins can manually return a rented car by a car id, while 
cars are actually automatically returned as the system scheduled everything when the order is 
created. 
As for customers, they are two kind of customer user. The first one is normal customers, 
including registered and not-registered customer, they are not required to login and they can 
view all cars available for rent and register as a new customer to access other details in the 
system. In short, the functionalities available for normal customers are very limited, 
customers should register as a new customer to access all functionalities designed for 
customers in the system. As for registered customers, they will need to enter their username 
P a g e | 4 
and password when they are entering the system. They can view their personal rental history 
and view detail of cars to be rented out from the system. They can also select and book a car 
for a specific duration with the system, there is no charge for booking and the car will be kept 
for customers for 24 hours, and customers are required to do their payment within 24 hours or 
else their booking and order will be terminated. All records of cars, registered users and 
orders will be stored in text files. In addition, before doing the coding, I will make the 
algorithm design which will include the pseudocode and the flowchart as the first step to 
develop the system.
